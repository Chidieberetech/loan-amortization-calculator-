# Loan-amortization-calculator
Python code for a loan amortization calculator with GUI using the Tkinter library
This code uses the Tkinter library to create a simple GUI that calculates the monthly and total payments 
for a loan amount, term, and interest rate. You can customize the values for the loan amount, term, and 
interest rate by modifying the values in the input fields. The program will then calculate the monthly 
and total payments and display them in the output fields.
